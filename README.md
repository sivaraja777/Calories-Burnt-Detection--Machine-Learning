# Calories-Burnt-Detection--Machine-Learningn

## Overview
Calories Burnt Detection is a data analysis project that utilizes machine learning to predict the number of calories burnt based on various physiological and activity-related parameters. The project leverages the Random Forest model to provide accurate estimations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains various physiological metrics and activity data necessary for calorie burn prediction.

## Features
- **Input Parameters:** Various physiological metrics and activity levels.
- **Output:** Estimated calories burnt.
- **Model Used:** Random Forest for regression-based prediction.

## How to Use
1. Load the dataset into your preferred data analysis environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Python).
2. Preprocess the data and apply the Random Forest model.
3. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics.

## Dependencies
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Project Notebook
The complete project implementation can be found in the Jupyter Notebook file: `Final_Project_Notebook.ipynb`
